# A Logical Attack on the Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever

This repository contains an original question I developed to break the internal logic of the Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever.

The question — *“If a god can tell the truth, can he also lie?”* — destabilizes the framework by introducing a truth condition that causes undefined behavior across all three god identities (truth-teller, liar, and random). The result is a breakdown of the puzzle’s assumptions and a collapse of its solution model.

This is not a new puzzle. It is a targeted philosophical exploit of a very specific logic structure.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Establish authorship and timestamp the creation
- Share the logic with others interested in formal reasoning and paradoxes
- Invite further discussion and critique
