The Logical Deadlock Question in Boolos' Hardest Logic Puzzle
Overview
This document introduces and analyzes a novel question within the framework of George Boolos’ “Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever.” The question is:
“If a god can tell the truth, can it also lie?”
This question, while syntactically valid and rule-compliant within the puzzle's structure, leads to a logical deadlock: none of the three gods (True, False, or Random) can answer it without violating their behavioral constraints. This document serves as the definitive explanation and authorship record of the question and the system-level paradox it reveals.

Puzzle Background
Boolos' original puzzle (1996) involves:
Three gods: Truth (always tells the truth), Liar (always lies), and Random (answers randomly as either Truth or Liar).
The solver may ask three yes/no questions, one per god per question.
Responses are given in an unknown language using "da" and "ja" for yes/no.
The solver does not know which word means "yes" and which means "no."
The goal is to determine which god is which.
The challenge is complicated by the language ambiguity and Random’s unpredictable behavior.

The Question’s Structure
“If a god can tell the truth, can it also lie?”
This question is:
Grammatically well-formed.
Logically structured as a binary conditional.
Addressed to a single god.
Free of direct reference to other gods or paradoxical recursion.
It appears answerable, yet it causes a total system freeze.

Why No God Can Answer
Truth (the god who can only tell the truth)
Must respond truthfully.
Truth knows it cannot lie.
Truth knows Random can both lie and tell the truth.
Therefore, the premise is both true and untrue.
A binary answer would misrepresent reality.
→ Truth is paralyzed.
Liar (the god who can only lie)
Must respond with a lie.
Liar knows Truth cannot lie.
Liar knows Random can both lie and tell the truth.
Therefore, the premise is both true and untrue.
No consistent lie can be formed from an undefined truth value.
→ Liar is paralyzed.
Random (the coin-flipper)
Randomly chooses to act as Truth or Liar.
Once Random's behavior is selected, it must follow that mode.
Random then inherits the paralysis of whichever mode it adopted.
→ Random is paralyzed.

Implication
This creates a previously undocumented form of failure in the puzzle:
Not contradiction.
Not invalid syntax.
But logical insufficiency—a system-compliant question that no agent can answer without self-violation.
This is similar in spirit to Gödel’s incompleteness theorem: a system that cannot prove all truths within its rules.

Distinction From Prior Paradoxes
Previous solutions (e.g., Rabern, Uzquiano) introduce paradox through reference or require gods to be stumped by others' behavior.
This question causes failure within the agent’s role-based logic.
It does not require external contradictions, language tricks, or altered rules.
